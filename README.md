# Simple login form

This is a simple HTML and CSS project. I use here raw CSS to design this page. Get ideas from the internet and try to implement them.

- This form has two sections. The first one is for login and another for register.
- The login part, I named the part as sign-in. There is a simple form title, social media link two fields, and also has forget password option.
- And, the second form is for registration. this form is also the same design as the sign-in form.
- When a user shifts one part to another, then there is simple animation to show the form.
